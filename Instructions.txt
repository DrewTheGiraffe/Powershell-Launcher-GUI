Intro: 
I am going to keep this as brief as possible. 
Welcome to the script collection. This took my team of three excellent soldiers roughly 4 months to get 
where it is today. The collaboration effort has been extensive. Please do not take credit for work we 
put countless hours into to make possible for all of you. 


Instructions:
Once you get the email, 

Drag the collection package out of your email into the following directory on your computer.

C:\temp

This directory is case sensitive, so change it if your directory is C:\Temp or something similar but not
exact. 
Right Click "Extract All".
Re-name Extraction Path to: 
C:\temp
instead of: 
C:\temp\Launcher   

Open Command Prompt with your SA/WA Token "CMD" as administrator. 
Now type the following commands in order. [CASE SENSITIVE]

cd C:\temp\Launcher

powershell

.\Launcher

Great now you should be presented with the Launchers GUI!
Congrats, Choose any script from the drop down menu and the launcher will prepare it for you.
One final note I would like to mention. 
Use the output windows associated with the selected script to check progress of the scripts progress as well
as any instructions it may have for you. 
Change logs for script updates can be found here: C:\temp\Launcher\Changelogs
