This script was designed to be used in conjunction with phycally locked computers in a supervised environment by an administrator.

Function: 

Creates local user account for users to login to instead of logging in with a visitors account. 
This way users can save account paperwork to the desktop for administrators to easily manage and upload to respective network share locations.
This was designed to stop a computer from bottle-necking under the weight of hundreds of visitor accounts.
Keep in mind this script should never be used on a regular users computer and only on computers that can be monitored by administrators.
