######################################### UPDATE 12/21/2021 #########################################

Converted alot of code to not rely on PSEXEC suite and run strictly off of Powershell Remoting Protocols.
Next update will completely remote psexec support from general tech (trust me processes are faster).
I fixed the RCC flag for suspicious remote activity over NIPR domain. 
Any previous versions of generaltech should be removed and version 5 should be the only one you use.
Added encryption for secure passwords (Local Admin).
Added Obfuscation for secure strings stored at rest on script.

Note: 
I will soon ETS from the army so I will soley rely on you IMO's / SA Users to report bugs. 
Take care and happy holidays from my entire S6 team & I. ~ SPC Burgess, Drew J 2-3 FA S6
