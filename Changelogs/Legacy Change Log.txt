######################################### UPDATE 12/21/2021 #########################################

Converted alot of code to not rely on PSEXEC suite and run strictly off of Powershell Remoting Protocols.
Next update will completely remote psexec support from general tech (trust me processes are faster). 
Any previous versions of generaltech should be removed and version 5 should be the only one you use.
Added encryption for secure passwords (Local Admin).
Added Obfuscation for secure strings stored at rest on script.
