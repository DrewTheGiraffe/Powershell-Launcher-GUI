General Tech Script Explanation 05/05/2021 
By PFC Leonard, Reilly W

General Tech is used for daily remote management tasks like pinging, querying information, running cmd or powershell,
deleting/enabling local admins and more!!

If you launched the General Tech selection, your window will appear now.
Enter the hostname of the system you're trying to access.

Here is how each button works!!

PLEASE NOTE:
Click the button ONCE, don't spam it. The progress will report in the output window and let you know when complete or 
needs you to do something.

IP Info- Runs the command "ipconfig" and outputs a .txt file of information
Restart- Runs the command "-s shutdown -r -t 0" then immediately restarts the PC
Shutdown- Runs the command "-s shutdown -s -t 0" then immediately shuts down the PC

######################################### UPDATE 12/21/2021 #########################################

Converted alot of code to not rely on PSEXEC suite and run strictly off of Powershell Remoting Protocols.
Next update will completely remote psexec support from general tech (trust me processes are faster).
I fixed the RCC flag for suspicious remote activity over NIPR domain. 
Any previous versions of generaltech should be removed and version 5 should be the only one you use.
Added encryption for secure passwords (Local Admin).
Added Obfuscation for secure strings stored at rest on script.
