Instructions: 
All Application paths have been updated to read from a file located here: 
C:\temp\Launcher\Dependencies\Directories

Feel free to change any path to your share drive / NEC's Share Drive.
The WinGUI Installation is handled locally as my Network Enterprise Center has removed the installer
from there share drive at the time of this release. Installer is still valid and compliant for NIPR systems.

Do not Edit the file name located here: 
C:\temp\Launcher\Dependencies\Packages

The script is hard coded to read both the zip file and executable located inside. 

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me.
