# Powershell-Launcher-GUI
Powershell Script Collection For Help Desk Automations
Greetings Friends!
Today I am Officially releasing the Powershell Script Collection for use outside of my organization. 
I was a 4 year specialist in the U.S. Army.
Feel Free to fork this, I hope this helps somebody!


# Credits
Big thanks to Jonathan Santiago, my partner and battle buddie for working above and beyond to bring these scripts to light. Thank you to Mike Sloan for providing not only breath taking experience with his knowledge of powershell, but also mentorship in helping young eager to learn developers make there way in the world. Thank you to dozens of sources (all labeled in respective scripts) both in and around Reddit & StackOverflow, for making the job of learning this seemingly endless possibility of a programming language, that much easier to grasp everyday. Thank you Reilly, for providing support on write ups and taking the time to learn something completely out of scope of your job. Thank you to all the users of this suite who have provided feedback on bugs or new ideas to be implemented. 
We would not have come this far without all of you. I am unlikely to continue development on this project, but I hope it sparks new developers in the help desk industry to come forward and learn a new skill to better your life as a help desk tech / system administrator. Thats all for now, take care everyone. -Drew
